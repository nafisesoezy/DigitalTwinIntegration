OFAM3-WOMBAT-Integrated:
  title: "Integrated OFAM3–WOMBAT Model"
  unique_identifier: OFAM3_WOMBAT_2013
  model_version: "1.0"
  description: |
    A fully integrated ocean modeling system coupling the Ocean Forecasting
    Australian Model, version 3 (OFAM3), with the Whole Ocean Model of Biogeochemistry
    And Trophic-dynamics (WOMBAT). OFAM3 provides a near-global, eddy-resolving
    physical ocean circulation framework, while WOMBAT simulates nutrient, carbon,
    oxygen, and ecosystem cycling. Together, they form a comprehensive Earth system
    ocean model for hindcasts and scenario-based studies.
