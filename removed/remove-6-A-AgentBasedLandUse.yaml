  unique_identifier: ABM_LandUse_ES_2013
  model_version: '1.0'
  description: A spatially explicit agent-based model simulating land-use decisions
    by individual agents, considering economic, policy, and environmental factors.
  keywords:
  - Agent-based modeling
  - Land-use change
  - Spatial simulation
  - Decision-making
  - Policy impact
  model_type: Mechanistic
  scope: Regional landscapes (parcel-level land-use)
  purpose_pattern:
    purpose: Simulate land-use decisions under different policy and economic scenarios
    pattern: Autonomous agent decisions on spatial grid
  assumptions:
  - Agent decisions influenced by utility, neighbors, and regulations
  - Each land unit belongs to one agent
  - Spatial decision rules are uniform within agent types
  dimensionality: 2D
  spatial_extent: Agricultural region
  spatial_resolution: Parcel/grid cell (~1 ha)
  variable_spatial_resolution: false
  temporal_extent: Multi-decadal
  temporal_resolution: Annual
  variable_temporal_resolution: false
  calibration_tools_data: Historical land-use and agent behavior data

  conceptual_evaluation: Behavioral rules and agent structure validated against theory
  validation_capabilities: Calibrated against historical land use maps
  sensitivity_analysis: Tested across parameter sweeps (utility weights, policy levers)
  uncertainty_analysis: Scenario-based analysis of decision rules
  error_handling: Conflict resolution rules, boundary constraints
