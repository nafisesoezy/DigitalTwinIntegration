  title: SHYFEM Hydrodynamic Model
  unique_identifier: SHYFEM_Venice_2003
  model_version: 3D
  description: A finite element hydrodynamic model designed to simulate water levels,
    currents, salinity, and temperature in complex coastal and lagoon environments.
    Includes wetting/drying processes suitable for shallow intertidal zones.
