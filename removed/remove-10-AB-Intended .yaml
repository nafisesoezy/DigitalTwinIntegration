  title: "Intended: Coupled Sea-Ice–Ocean Modeling Framework"
  unique_identifier: ""
  model_version: ""
  description: >
    A conceptual framework to integrate a sea-ice dynamics/thermodynamics model with an
    ocean general circulation model (OGCM), optionally via a coupler. The goal is to
    simulate polar ocean–ice interactions and evaluate sensitivity to forcing and parameters.
    Specific submodels (sea-ice, ocean, coupler) are not yet selected.

  keywords:
    - Sea ice
    - Ocean circulation
    - Polar climate
    - Model coupling
    - Flux exchange
    - Thermodynamics

  model_type: "Mechanistic (coupled)"
  scope: ""
  purpose_pattern:
    purpose: "Simulate two-way interactions between sea ice and ocean to assess climatological and process-level questions"
    pattern: "Modular integration (sea-ice + ocean + optional coupler)"

  assumptions:
    - "Sea ice treated as continuum (tentative)"
    - "Hydrostatic, Boussinesq ocean (tentative)"
    - "Bulk flux formulations at the ice–ocean interface (tentative)"
    - "Atmospheric forcing prescribed (reanalysis/climatology; TBD)"
    - "No biogeochemistry (initially; TBD)"
