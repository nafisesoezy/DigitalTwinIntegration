  description: "\n            A modular aquatic ecosystem modeling system that couples\
    \ the GOTM hydrodynamic model with the PCLake+ ecological model through the FABM\
    \ framework.\n            This integration allows for dynamic simulation of both\
    \ physical and ecological processes in lakes and coastal waters.\n        "
