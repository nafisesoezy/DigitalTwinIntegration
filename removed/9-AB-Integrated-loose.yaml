  description: "\n            The Canadian Earth System Model version 2 (CanESM2)\
    \ integrates the CanAM4 atmospheric model with the NCOM1.3 ocean model.\n    \
    \        This coupled system simulates global climate dynamics including the impact\
    \ of stratospheric aerosols on surface temperature and precipitation.\n      \
