  description: >
    A fully coupled wave–ocean modeling system integrating NEMO (ocean general circulation model) 
    and ECWAM (spectral wave model) to account for surface wave effects in ocean dynamics. 
    The coupling enables exchange of wave-modified surface stress, Stokes drift, and turbulent 
    kinetic energy flux from breaking waves, improving realism in upper-ocean processes and air–sea interaction.
