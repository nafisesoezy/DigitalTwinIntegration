  description: "\n            A one-way coupled modeling system that integrates SHYFEM\
    \ (a 3D finite element hydrodynamic model) \n            with WASP5 (a water quality\
    \ and ecological model) to simulate the physical and biogeochemical dynamics \n\
    \            of the Venice Lagoon. The SHYFEM model provides flow, salinity, and\
    \ temperature fields that drive \n            the transport and transformation\
    \ of nutrients and phytoplankton in WASP5.\n        "
