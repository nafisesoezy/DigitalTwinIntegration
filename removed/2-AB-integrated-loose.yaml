  description: >
    A modular modeling framework that integrates marine ice sheet models (MISMIP+) 
    with regional ocean circulation models (ISOMIP+) to simulate the coupled dynamics 
    of ice sheet retreat and ocean-induced basal melting. MISOMIP1 is designed for idealized 
    domains resembling the Amundsen Sea Embayment to assess the feedbacks between ocean 
    circulation and grounding-line migration under varying thermal conditions.
