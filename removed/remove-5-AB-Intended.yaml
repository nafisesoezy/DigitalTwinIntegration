  description: "\n            A conceptual placeholder for an integrated modeling\
    \ system that couples physical hydrodynamic processes \n            with ecological\
    \ and water quality dynamics in coastal or lagoon systems. Specific model components\
    \ will \n            be selected based on accuracy, compatibility, and data availability.\n\
