  description: >
    A conceptual integration plan for embedding a one-dimensional lake model within a
    regional atmospheric model. The intended goal is to represent two-way interactions
    between lake surfaces and the overlying atmosphere, including heat, moisture, and
    momentum exchanges, as well as seasonal ice/snow cover on lakes. Model components
    are not yet selected.

  keywords:
    - Atmosphere–lake coupling
    - Surface fluxes
    - Lake ice and snow
    - Lower boundary condition
    - Climate and weather simulation
    - Embedded modeling

  model_type: "Mechanistic"
  scope: "Regional atmospheric domains containing inland water bodies"
  purpose_pattern:
    purpose: "Simulate feedbacks between lake surface states and atmospheric conditions"
    pattern: "Embedded coupling of a 1-D lake column into the atmospheric surface scheme"

  assumptions:
    - "Atmospheric model provides near-surface meteorological and radiative forcing to lake"
    - "Lake model returns surface state variables and fluxes for atmospheric lower boundary"
    - "Compatible time step and spatial grid over lake grid points"
    - "Energy and mass are conserved at the interface"
