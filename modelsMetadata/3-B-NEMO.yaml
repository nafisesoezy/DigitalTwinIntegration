  description: >
    A state-of-the-art ocean general circulation model for simulating the global ocean,
    including thermohaline circulation and upper-ocean mixing. In configurations with
    wave coupling, NEMO ingests Stokes drift, sea-state dependent momentum flux, and
    wave-breaking TKE flux to represent wave effects on currents and mixing.
