  title: "Individual-Based Plant Model (IBM)"
  unique_identifier: "IBM_Vegetation_Model_2017"
  model_version: "1.0"
  description: >
    A spatially explicit individual-based model simulating plant growth, mortality, dispersal,
    and competition, with each plant represented as an agent interacting locally with neighbors
    and the environment. Designed for coupling with a soil feedback submodel.
