  model_version: ""
  description: >
    A conceptual loose-coupling plan between a spectral wave model and an ocean circulation model.
    Wave fields (e.g., Stokes drift, wave-modified stress, breaking-induced TKE flux) are provided
    to the ocean; the ocean can return surface currents and sea-ice fraction to the wave model.
    Exchanges occur via files or a coupler at a coarse cadence (no in-memory synchronization).
  keywords:
    - Wave–ocean coupling
    - Stokes drift
    - Sea-state dependent stress
    - Upper-ocean mixing
    - NetCDF exchange
    - Coupler
  model_type: "Mechanistic (intended)"
  scope: "Regional or global upper-ocean systems influenced by surface waves"
  purpose_pattern:
    purpose: "Simulate bidirectional interactions between waves and ocean mixing/circulation"
    pattern: "Modular integration of wave model with ocean model via file/coupler exchange"

  assumptions:
    - "Components expose required variables (drift, stress, fluxes, currents, sea-ice)"
    - "Cadence allows lagged feedback without every-step sync"
    - "Units, sign conventions, and grids can be harmonized (remapping as needed)"
