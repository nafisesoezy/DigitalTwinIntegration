  description: >
    A conceptual framework to integrate a physical lake model with an ecological process model
    and an ecosystem service evaluation module. The goal is to simulate the influence of
    restoration and climate scenarios on ecological state and ecosystem service provisioning
    in freshwater lake systems. Specific model components will be selected based on fitness
    for purpose and availability.
