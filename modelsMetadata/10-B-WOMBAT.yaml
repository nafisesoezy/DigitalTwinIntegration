  unique_identifier: "WOMBAT_Model_2013"
  model_version: "2013.1"
  description: "WOMBAT is a three-dimensional NPZD-type ocean biogeochemistry model, including nutrients, phytoplankton, zooplankton, detritus, and extensions for carbon, oxygen, and iron cycles. It is designed to simulate large-scale biogeochemical cycling and ecosystem responses when coupled to ocean circulation models."
