  description: "\n        A tightly coupled spatially explicit modeling framework\
    \ integrating an individual-based plant model \n        with a cellular automaton-based\
    \ soil feedback model. Plants grow, compete, and disperse while modifying \n \
    \       soil state locally. Soil states in turn influence plant survival and establishment\
    \ via negative feedback mechanisms.\n    "

  model_type: Mechanistic
  scope: Local to landscape-level ecological systems
  purpose_pattern:
    purpose: Simulate emergent vegetation patterns driven by dynamic soil feedback
      loops
    pattern: 'Bidirectional integration: plants modify soil, soil modifies plant establishment'
  assumptions:
  - Soil is updated synchronously based on local plant history
  - Plant performance is sensitive to soil memory states
  - Feedback is negative and local, decaying over time
