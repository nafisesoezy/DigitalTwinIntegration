  title: "Integrated Plant–Soil Feedback Simulation Model"
  unique_identifier: ""
  model_version: ""
  description: >
    A spatially explicit ecological simulation integrating an individual-based plant model
    with a grid-based soil feedback model. Vegetation growth, mortality, and reproduction
    are influenced by local soil conditions, while plant presence modifies soil properties.
  keywords:
    - Integrated ecological modeling
    - Individual-based model
    - Soil feedback
    - Plant–soil interactions
    - Spatial ecology
  model_type: "Mechanistic"
  scope: "Patch- to landscape-scale vegetation–soil feedback dynamics"
  purpose_pattern:
    purpose: "Simulate coupled vegetation and soil processes to explore how feedbacks shape spatial patterns and community structure"
    pattern: "Loose coupling between agent-based vegetation submodel and grid-based soil feedback submodel"
  assumptions:
    - Both submodels use identical grid extents and resolutions
    - Coupling occurs once per simulated year
    - Variables are exchanged without unit conversions
