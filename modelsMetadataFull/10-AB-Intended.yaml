  unique_identifier: ""
  model_version: ""
  description: >
    A conceptual integration of the OFAM3 physical ocean model and the WOMBAT
    biogeochemical model. The framework is designed to simulate interactions
    between ocean circulation and nutrient/biogeochemical processes at
    near-global scale. Specific configurations and parameters depend on use case.
