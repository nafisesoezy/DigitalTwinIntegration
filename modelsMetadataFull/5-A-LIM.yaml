  description: >
    Two-dimensional dynamic–thermodynamic sea-ice model with a three-layer thermodynamics
    scheme (snow: 1 layer; ice: 2 layers) and viscous–plastic (VP) rheology; advection via
    second-order moments (Prather) and parameterized lead formation/closure. Coupled to OPA
    to exchange momentum, heat, and freshwater fluxes.
