  title: "User-Defined Coupled MISMIP+–ISOMIP+ workflow"
  unique_identifier: ""
  model_version: ""
  description: >
    A conceptual loose-coupling workflow between an idealized marine ice-sheet experiment (MISMIP+)
    and an idealized ice-shelf–ocean experiment (ISOMIP+). Geometry from the ice model drives
    the ocean melt calculation, and the resulting sub-shelf melt rates drive the next ice evolution step.
    Exchanges occur via NetCDF files at defined coupling intervals (no in-memory synchronization).

  keywords:
    - Model integration
    - Loose coupling
    - Ice–ocean interaction
    - Sub-shelf melt
    - Grounding line
    - NetCDF exchange

  model_type: "Mechanistic (intended)"
  scope: "Idealized marine ice-sheet/shelf–ocean system"
  purpose_pattern:
    purpose: "Iteratively assess ice–ocean feedbacks using file-based exchanges between specialized models"
    pattern: "Loose two-way coupling via offline NetCDF file exchange"

  assumptions:
    - "Both models operate on compatible or mappable grids"
    - "Coupling cadence is coarse (iterative/batch), allowing lagged feedback"
    - "Units and sign conventions are harmonized across exchanges"
    - "No hard requirement for identical timesteps; remapping may be needed"
