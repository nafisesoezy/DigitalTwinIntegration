  title: Integrated Agent-Based Land-Use and Ecosystem Services Model
  unique_identifier: ABM_ES_Coupled_2013
  model_version: '1.0'
  description: "\n            This integrated model combines a spatially explicit\
    \ agent-based land-use model with an ecosystem services meta-model. \n       \
    \     Land-use decisions by agents dynamically update land cover, which is passed\
    \ to the ES module that calculates carbon storage, erosion control, and agricultural\
    \ yield.\n            These ES indicators then influence agent decision-making\
    \ in a feedback loop.\n        "
