  description: "\n            A fully integrated aquatic ecosystem model coupling\
    \ the General Lake Model (GLM) with the PCLake+ ecological model via the FABM\
    \ interface.\n            This framework simulates interactions between hydrodynamics\
    \ (e.g., stratification, temperature) and ecological processes (e.g., phytoplankton,\
    \ nutrients, macrophytes).\n            Enables simulation of ecosystem responses\
    \ to climate change and restoration actions.\n        "
