  unique_identifier: "ORCA2_LIM_UCL_LODYC_2005"
  model_version: "OPA 8.2 + LIM (1997/1999 thermodynamics, VP dynamics)"
  description: "Two-way coupled sea-ice–ocean system on the ORCA2 tripolar grid (78°S–90°N, ~2° mean resolution), evaluating high-latitude processes, sea-ice variability, and ocean circulation under combined reanalysis/climatology forcing."
  keywords:
    - Coupled model
    - ORCA2 grid
    - High latitudes
    - Sea-ice–ocean interaction
    - Convection sites
    - Sensitivity studies
  model_type: "Mechanistic (coupled)"
  scope: "Global ocean with explicit Arctic/Antarctic sea-ice cover"
  purpose_pattern:
    purpose: "Assess representation of high-latitude processes and sea-ice variability in a coarse-resolution global model"
    pattern: "OPA–LIM two-way coupling exchanging momentum, heat and freshwater fluxes at fixed intervals"
  assumptions:
    - "Bulk exchange at ice–ocean interface; drag and heat transfer laws per literature."
    - "SSS restoring used to limit drift and avoid spurious convection."
    - "Coarse grid under-resolves narrow currents and small polynya features."

  conceptual_model_evaluation: "Realistic seasonal growth/decay, drift, and major convection sites; some regional biases remain."
  uncertainty_analysis: "Sensitivity to forcing choice (NCEP stress vs wind), SSS restoring, and ice parameters."
  sensitivity_analysis: "Using NCEP wind stress directly overestimates ice drift; dropping SSS restoring triggers Southern Ocean open-ocean convection."
